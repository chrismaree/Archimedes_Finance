General
=======
* Nothing is set in stone. It is all an ongoing experiment.
* Everyone is encouraged & expected to suggest changes to our process
* We deal with ultra bleeding edge, high stakes technology


Coding
======
* We review (short) design docs (before coding)
* Code the unit test first
* Commits are small and focused around a single logical path
* We do 2 code reviews: in-person (live walkthrough) then offline PR. Anyone in Engineering is fair game to play a live/offline reviewer
* Leave optimization until last and have a bias for simplicity


Testing
=======
* All code must have unit tests (and pass them)
* There are no QA people - we responsible for the quality of our work
